Be different – Be deliberate and don’t do things just because other people do them.\xa0 Be authentic. Don’t be boring – We need to stand out among all the noise.\xa0 Everything we do in public should provide value to the audience. Hiring Process Our first step is to ask applicants to fill out a Google form with some relatively easy questions.\xa0 Our goal here is to be able to easily weed out applicants who apply without reading the job post or who are not qualified.

A joint-coding session with the founder. Short interviews with our other two employees for a culture fit.
